ZX Spectrum Pico Interface One
==============================

Implement an Interface One using a Pico. Currently envisaged as a software only
microdrive emulator, providing a high volume storage facility the traditional
way. I wasn't planning doing an actual Microdrive emulation, or the network.



Pico-1 Emulates the IF1 ROM
===========================

Error Handling
--------------

The Service Manual says the Spectrum transfers to address 0x08 when it hits an
error. Putting a breakpoint on that address in Fuse shows it gets hit a various
points. Enter garbage and it gets hit when you'd expect to see the ? symbol come
up. It gets hit at the "D Break - CONT repeats" message. It seems to be the
standard error handler point.

0x08 is called via a RST 8 instruction. That's got CALL semantics, it PUSHes the
PC ready for a RET.

There's a disassembly of the IF1 ROM here: https://www.tablix.org/~avian/spectrum/rom/if1_2.htm

The IF1 hardware traps the address and Z80 lines when it goes to read an instruction from
address 0x08. Thus, when the ROM (or user program) calls that address the IF1 ROM is
already in place.


How does the ROM get paged?
---------------------------

Hardware looks for 0x0008.

AAAA AAAA AAAA AAAA
1111 1100 0000 0000
5432 1098 7654 3210

0000 0000 0000 1000
  *  *    ***   ***        Marked address lines are fed into IC3

That's bit A3 being one, all others being zero.


Also, hardware looks for 0x1708.

AAAA AAAA AAAA AAAA
1111 1100 0000 0000
5432 1098 7654 3210

0001 0111 0000 1000
  *  *    ***   ***        Marked address lines are fed into IC3

That's bit A3, A8, A9, A10 and A12 being one, all others being zero.


How does the ROM get unpaged?
-----------------------------

UNPAGE is at 0x0700 in the IF1 disassembly.

AAAA AAAA AAAA AAAA
1111 1100 0000 0000
5432 1098 7654 3210

0000 0111 0000 0000
  *  *    ***   ***        Marked address lines are fed into IC3

That's bits A8, A9 and A10 being one, all others being zero.

It contains a single RET instruction so the stack needs to have the required return
address ready. Assumption is that the IF1 ROM is unpaged when address 0x0700 has been
read. Not sure how.

From Kiwi at Spectrum Computing:

There are three addresses where the paging mechanism kicks in:

0x0008 - error RST - page in
0x1708 - channel handler - page in
0x0700 - page out

The LS260 NOR gates, diode AND gate and ULA decode these addresses
along with M1 and MREQ to determine when a paging event occurs. If you
decode all the other address bits then A3 indicates if the shadow ROM
should be paged in or out.

In hardware terms, the paging mechanism can be thought of as a two
stage process. The first stage flags if a paging event has occurred -
it decodes the address bits, MREQ and M1 and uses the signal as a
clock input to a LS74 flip flop, with A3 being the data input. The
second stage delays the actual paging of the ROM to the next
instruction. It does this with a second flip flop where the clock
input is the falling edge of M1 and data is the stage 1 page flag. The
combined mechanism recognises the page address and delays the ROM page
until the next M1 cycle (when it pages immediately).

This means that the CPU picks up the return instruction in the IF1 ROM
at 0x0700, executes the instruction (changing the PC), and the on CPU
setting up the address bus to get the instruction at the new PC
location, i.e. M1 active, the IF1 ROM pages out immediately meaning
the CPU picks up the value from the 48K ROM/RAM and normal execution
continues.

Pcio-1 Conclusion
-----------------

This is implemented in my ROM emulator. It requires the entire Pico,
all 26 GPIOs. The magic address ROM paging is done in software.

Proven working, final version needs the /M1 signal which I've got in
place on the schematic.



Pico-2 Emulates the IF1 Hardware
================================


Data Bus (8 GPIOs required)
---------------------------

8 lines required, all need level shifting and direction swapping. Input from ZX is needed
for the IF1 to receive the data to be written to the microdrive. Output to the ZX is
needed for the ROM emulation and to pass read data out to the ZX.

The ROM emulation only needs output data lines. The ROM emulator project ties the
direction of the level shifter to Pico->ZX. That needs changing because Pico-2 needs
to handle INs (Pico->ZX) and OUTs (ZX->Pico).


Z80 Control Bus (3 GPIOs required)
----------------------------------

The ROM part uses /MREQ; Pico-2 needs /IORQ.

/RD and /WR  are required so Pico-2 can tell when it needs to field an IN or an OUT.

Pico-1 only needs Pico->ZX, which is B->A, which is low on the pin. Pico-2 needs
both directions. But I can't have Pico-1 driving the data bus when Pico-2 wants
it, so I need to update the ROM emulation software to keep the data bus GPIOs as
inputs until they need to output their value.

The data bus level shifter should be permanently enabled. I'll tie /RD to the
shifter's direction pin then a read from ROM or a read of the IO space will set the
shifter to Pico->ZX, switching straight back when the read finishes. The ROM code
(Pico-1) needs to keep the data bus GPIOs as inputs while it's not supplying a data
byte. A write-to-ROM won't change the level shifter, so that scenario is harmless.
ROM_ACCESS_INV now appears redundant.

One issue: one of the Picos will have it's databus GPIOs set as outputs. When the
Z80's read finishes the /RD will go high and the level shifter will drive its
3V3 side as outputs. I don't want both Pico and level shifter driving each other,
but there's no easy alternative. So I'll put some resistors inline to prevent
too much current flowing from one device to the other. It'll only be brief, I
think it'll be OK.










Pico-3 Handles the user interface
=================================

Currently assuming an SD card reader and an LCD screen. Some buttons or a rotary?
Not sure. This comes later.



I think this is the one AM uses:

How does Fuse code work?
========================

The Z80 opcode handler for IN uses a function called readport(). That's in periph.c, it loops
over a list of 'port' structures calling a function called read_peripheral(). That looks at
the list entry and the port being read by the Z80 and calls the handler function for either
a port read or a port write if the IN instruction the Z80 is running matches what's been
registered. The IF1's port input and output functions are if1_port_in() and if1_port_out():

static const periph_port_t if1_ports[] = {
  { 0x0018, 0x0010, if1_port_in, if1_port_out },
  { 0x0018, 0x0008, if1_port_in, if1_port_out },
  { 0x0018, 0x0000, if1_port_in, if1_port_out },
  { 0, 0, NULL, NULL }
};

Putting a breakpoint on one and doing a CAT 1 command gives:

(gdb) bt
#0  if1_port_in (port=24559, attached=0x7fffffffdc46 "") at peripherals/if1.c:787
#1  0x0000555555588aad in read_peripheral (data=<optimised out>, user_data=0x7fffffffdc44) at periph.c:304
#2  0x00007ffff7154b20 in g_slist_foreach () at /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libglib-2.0.so.0
#3  0x0000555555589057 in readport_internal (port=24559) at periph.c:344
#4  readport_internal (port=<optimised out>) at periph.c:312
#5  0x00005555555891a4 in readport (port=port@entry=24559) at periph.c:277
#6  0x00005555555ed965 in z80_do_opcodes () at ./z80/opcodes_base.c:944
#7  0x000055555558001d in main (argc=<optimised out>, argv=<optimised out>) at fuse.c:203

Decoding the port gives 1 of 3 responses:

static enum if1_port
decode_port( libspectrum_word port )
{
    switch( port & 0x0018 ) {
    case 0x0000: return PORT_MDR;
    case 0x0008: return PORT_CTR;
    case 0x0010: return PORT_NET;
        default: return PORT_UNKNOWN;
    }
}

0xF7 & 0x18 gives 0x10, so port 0xF7 is PORT_NET  (network)
0xEF & 0x18 gives 0x08, so port 0xEF is PORT_CTR  (control)
0xE7 & 0x18 gives 0x00, so port 0xE7 is PORT_MDR  (microdrive)

The one I want is the MDR one, so if1_port_in() for a read calls port_mdr_in(). Which 
is this:


static libspectrum_byte
port_mdr_in( void )
{
  libspectrum_byte ret = 0xff;
  int m;

  for( m = 0; m < 8; m++ ) {

    microdrive_t *mdr = &microdrive[ m ];

    if( mdr->motor_on && mdr->inserted ) {

      if( mdr->transfered < mdr->max_bytes ) {
	mdr->last = libspectrum_microdrive_data( mdr->cartridge,
						   mdr->head_pos );
	increment_head( m );
      }

      mdr->transfered++;
      ret &= mdr->last;  /* I assume negative logic, but how know? */
    }

  }

  return ret;
}

So for each microdrive, if it's on and inserted, read some data, increment the head
position. This seems to work with the idea that more than one microdrive can be
running, which is not possible in hardware as far as I know. Nevertheless, it merges
the bytes read from each device and that's what it returns. It also returns the next
byte in the data sequence (i.e on the tape) for each IN instruction.

I think what's happening is that each IN instruction is assumed to be reading the
next byte from the IF1 ULA. The IF1 does all the timing stuff, then says right,
/now/ is the time to read the next data byte from the stream. And that's what it
gets. In practise it doesn't matter what timing it puts in place, it'll get the next
byte in the stream regardless.


Logic to operate the level shifter
==================================

To switch the level shifter on the data bus to output mode (Pico->ZX) the ROM
read negative logic is

!(MREQ OR A14 OR A15 OR RD)

So if A14/5, or MREQ, or RD are high, keep it at input mode (ZX->Pico).
Otherwise pull it low (Pico->ZX).

So that's

(MREQ AND A14 AND A15 AND RD)


The IO Pico also needs to be able to switch that level shifter to output
mode (Pico->ZX)

(IORQ AND RD)

So if it's an IO, and it's a read, pull the level shifter direction low
(Pico->ZX).

So that's

!(IORQ OR RD)


/MREQ  A14  A15  DIR           /IORQ  /RD      DIR
  0     0    0    0               0    0        0         IO read (IN instruction)
  0     0    1    1               0    1        1         IO write (OUT instruction)
  0     1    0    1               1    0        1         Mem read
  0     1    1    1               1    1        1         Mem write
  1     0    0    1               
  1     0    1    1               
  1     1    0    1               
  1     1    1    1               


DIR = ( (MREQ OR A14 OR A15) AND (IORQ OR RD) )
